This site is meant to provide information on the [lawreneceaph/wp-gcloud-run repository](https://github.com/lawrenceaph/wp-gcloud-run), a fork of the [original](https://github.com/peterkracik/wp-gcloud-run).   

The repository contains all the files needed to build a container image for Google Cloud Run capable of running Wordpress 5.7.2, using PHP 8.0.6, connected to a cloud SQL database. 

Detailed instructions for using the updated repository can be found [here](https://lawrence.aritao.dev/deploying-wordpress-on-cloud-run-in-2021-d2f3c58b039b?source=friends_link&sk=2bd0cea0f374e9e78963281f54ad2ef5).
