# wp-gcloud-run

This site is meant to provide information on the [lawreneceaph/wp-gcloud-run repository](https://github.com/lawrenceaph/wp-gcloud-run), a fork of the [original](https://github.com/peterkracik/wp-gcloud-run). 

The repository contains all the files needed to build a container image for Google Cloud Run capable of running Wordpress 5.7.2, using the latest PHP release (based on official docker PHP), connected to a Google cloud SQL database. **Update 6-8-21**: I'm happy to share that the master branch of the [original](https://github.com/peterkracik/wp-gcloud-run) now also runs Wordpress 5.7.2, and PHP8+ after a successful merge. I will continue doing maintenance updates on the fork and opening pull requests incrementally. 

Detailed instructions for using the updated repository can be found [here](https://lawrence.aritao.dev/deploying-wordpress-on-cloud-run-in-2021-d2f3c58b039b?source=friends_link&sk=2bd0cea0f374e9e78963281f54ad2ef5). 

A sample site built using the container built through the repository can be found [here](https://aritao.org).

Cheers, and enjoy!
